Wear Tiles Sample
===============================
Demonstrates tiles using the new androidX alpha library.

Introduction
------------

[Tiles](https://d.android.com/training/articles/wear-tiles) provide users with swipeable access
to the things they need to know and get done right from their wrist. They are fast to access and
convenient, designed to provide users with what they need in the moment, which gives users control
over what information and actions they want to see.

This repository contains a set of sample implementations of Tiles, demonstrating various use cases.
Each Tile extends TileProviderService and implements onTileRequest and onResourcesRequest.
